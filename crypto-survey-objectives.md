# CRYPTO INSIGHTS SURVEY

## INTRODUCTION

The year 2022 was a very difficult one for the cryptocurrency industry. Between the collapse of Terra Luna and the implosion of the FTX exchange, prices have been in a downward spiral for months and many investors have lost large sums of money.

Therefore, it seemed useful to get a pulse of the general population's feelings towards the industry via a short survey.

## OBJECTIVES

Specifically, the following broad areas were explored:

* Awareness of and familiarity with cryptocurrencies
* Whether or not cryptocurrencies are currently owned (and which ones)
* Why (or why not) cryptocurrencies are currently owned
* Attitudes towards cryptocurrencies
* Likelihood to purchase cryptocurrencies in the future

## METHODOLOGY

An 18 question survey was distributed randomly to members of a QuestionPro Audience panel from December 22 - December 28, 2022. Survey respondents were from the United States. A total of 178 completed surveys were collected. Data was weighted by gender due to oversampling of females (69%). The data were processed and analyzed using SPSS.
